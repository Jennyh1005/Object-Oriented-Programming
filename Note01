Object
- An object in Computer Science (CS) can be a variable, data structure, function, or method
- It is a location in memory that holds a value referenced by an identifier
- An object in Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is an instance of a class
- It can be a variable, function, data structure or a combination of these.

The OOP Paradigm
- Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming practice for designing modular, reusable software systems
- OOP involves creating objects to represent entities in the program
- OOP focuses on defining data rather than the input → processing → output logic, which distinguishes it from procedure-oriented programming
- The goal of OOP is to create objects that have defined functionality to solve problems.
