Object:
- An object in Computer Science (CS) can be a variable, data structure, function, or method
- It is a location in memory that holds a value referenced by an identifier
- An object in Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is an instance of a class
- It can be a variable, function, data structure or a combination of these.

The OOP Paradigm:
- Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming practice for designing modular, reusable software systems
- OOP involves creating objects to represent entities in the program
- OOP focuses on defining data rather than the input → processing → output logic, which distinguishes it from procedure-oriented programming
- The goal of OOP is to create objects that have defined functionality to solve problems.

Conceptual Differentiation:
- Procedure-oriented programming focuses on fulfilling human requirements such as calculations, logical evaluations, and repetitive tasks
- OOP involves creating an object representing a human and defining its attributes such as name, address and functions it can perform
- OOP focuses on how to manipulate the data of an object rather than the logic required to manipulate them.

In-depth Analysis of an Object:
- An object is a combination of data and functional code, representing a real-world object that has states and behaviors
- An object is an instance of a class
- States are the measurable data that describe the characteristics of an object
- Behaviors are the available functionality of an object, indicating what it can do
- An object's data is called attributes
- An object's code is called methods.

An example object we can create in OOP is a dog:
- A dog object may have attributes such as name, color, breed, hungry, and thirsty
- A dog object may have methods such as bark, eat, and sleep
- Populating the dog's attributes (name, color, etc.) creates an instance of the dog object

Classes & Objects:
- In OOP, a class is an abstract description of all objects that can be created from it
- An object is instantiated from a class
- A class contains attributes, which are an object's accessible tools
- Fields are variables that belong to an object or class
- There are two types of fields: those that belong to an instance of the class and those that belong to the class itself
- Methods are functions that the object or the object's class can call.

OOP in Python 3:
"Keyword: class"
class | keyword | → A built-in keyword in Python 3 that allows to create our own classes.
- Example:
"# The Most Basic Class

class ClassName: # Notice that Class names are capitalized
	pass # An Empty Block
#end of ClassName

obj = ClassName()
print(obj)"

Create a Class:
1. First define the name of the class with the keyword: class
2. In its code block (indentation) define its attributes
3. Then you can assign a variable with an instantiation of the class to interact with it
- Make sure to use parentheses when calling the class name.
- example: 
"# Person Class
class Person:
	pass # An Empty Block
#end of Person Class

student1 = Person() #student1 is now a Person Object
print(student1)"

- example:
"class Person:
	def greet(self):
		print(‘Hello, how are you?’)
	#end of greet
	#end of class Person
	p = Person()
	p.greet() # outputs the greet message … 
	# the method is accessed with a period (.)
	# Wait… what is the self????"

The __init__ method & self parameter:
- The init method is executed as soon as an object of the class is instantiated
- It is used to initialize the object's attributes
- The "self" parameter is used to denote that the method is applied and accessible for the object itself
- "self" treats its own attributes as local
- Double underscores are key hidden features of Python that allow us to overwrite Python features and hidden content.

- example: person class
"class Person:
	def __init__(self, name):
		self.name = name
	#end of initialization
	
def greet(self): # the self parameter is always required
		print(“Hello, my name is”, self.name)
	#end of greet
#end of class Person

p = Person(‘Mr. Park’)
p.greet()"

Example: List
L = [1,2,3,4]
L is an instance of a <list class>; therefore, L is an object
Features:
L[i] → indexing … L[i:j] → Slicing
functions → len(), min(), max()
operators → + and *
methods → L.append(), L.count(), L.extend(), L.sort(), L.reverse()

NOTE: We didn’t need to know how these were coded, we just needed to know what list could do.
